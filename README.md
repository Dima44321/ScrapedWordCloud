# ScrapedWordCloud
Creates word cloud based off of Wikipedia article. Uses Beautiful Soup to get the text from the article as well as the first image. Then, applies image segmentation to create a mask for the word cloud.

Step to use:
1) Change the url variable to any Wikipedia article. Articles with people work best for the image segmentation algorithm. Other objects are not as well classified
